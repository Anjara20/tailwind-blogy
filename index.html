                <p class="text-sm leading-loose">
                    Most people don’t like to go to meetings; they disrupt work flow and are generally inconvenient. When planning a meeting, ask yourself if a face-to-face gathering of people is really necessary. Can you accomplish your goal on a conference call?
A meeting that has binders or other handouts or is scheduled to last more than an hour should be done face-to-face. Meeting to delegate known tasks between peers or to discuss followup actions required in an ongoing project can and should be done electronically. Everyone will thank you for respecting their time whether they say so or not.

                    singer Fy Rasolofoniaina is currently participating in the “raising royality award talent” evangelical singing contest which is held virtually on facebook. Our singer was selected for the grand finale. In order to win the contest, he asks for the support of everyone, and especially his fans by voting for him. The video that gets more reactions wins. With his guitar and harmonica, Fy was sensational, and deserves to win this international competition
